# ProctorManagementSystem
Proctor management system is a student information system that provides a simple interface for the maintenance of student information. It can be used by educational institutes or colleges to maintain the records of students easily. Achieving this objective is difficult using a manual system as the information is scattered, data can be redundant and collecting relevant information may be very time consuming. All these problems are solved using this online student information management system. This system focuses on presenting information in an easy and intelligible manner which provides facilities like online registration and profile creation of studentâ€™s thus reducing paper work and automating the record generation process in an educational institution.
The proposed system will automate the existing manual system used for management and maintenance of the critical information. It will reduce the numerous paper forms. It will act as single platform where different users can access the information across different dynamic pages. It aims at standardizing data, consolidating data, ensuring data integrity and reduces inconsistencies.
